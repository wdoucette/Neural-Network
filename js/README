The NeuralNetwork API has been written in both native C++ and JavaScript, and can be compiled against uClibc for use in embedded environments.

This JavaScript implementation is intended to bring the API to browser environments for both deployment and online and offline network training purpose.

-Training intensive tasks can be performed natively for offline training and the network ported for use in the JavaScript runtime.
